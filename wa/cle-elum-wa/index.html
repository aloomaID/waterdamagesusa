            <h3>Cle Elum, WA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Cle Elum (/kli ˈɛləm/ klee ELL-um) is a city in Kittitas County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,872 at the 2010 census. About 84 miles (135 km) by car from Seattle, Cle Elum is a popular area for camping and outdoor activities. It is also unofficially considered the starting point of Eastern Washington when driving east on I-90 from Seattle, although this is somewhat arbitrary since many consider either the town of Easton, anywhere east of Keechelus Lake, or the wildlife crossing bridge over I-90 to be the starting point.</p>
